# NotebookLM MCP Setup Guide (Local Integration)

This guide documents how to set up the NotebookLM MCP (Model Context Protocol) server locally to enable AI models (Claude, Gemini) to interact with your NotebookLM notebooks directly within your IDE.

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Required to run the MCP server using `npx`.
- **Antigravity / IDE**: An MCP-compatible environment.

## 2. Installation & Configuration

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

You can add the MCP server directly using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx -y @pleasepromptu/notebooklm-mcp setup
```

### Manual Configuration

Add the following configuration to your `mcp_config.json` (usually located in `~/.gemini/antigravity/` for Antigravity or your IDE's MCP config path):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notebooklm": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@pleasepromptu/notebooklm-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DEBUG": "mcp:*"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Authentication Flow

After adding the configuration, the first time you call a NotebookLM tool, you will need to authenticate:

1. The AI will trigger `mcp_notebooklm_setup_auth`.
2. A browser window will open.
3. Perform the manual Google Login.
4. Close the window once done.

## 4. Common Commands & Prompts

### For Library Management

- "Add this NotebookLM to my library: [URL]"
- "List all my notebooks"
- "Show stats of my NotebookLM library"

### For Querying

- "Query my NotebookLM about [Topic]"
- "What does [Notebook ID] say about [Subject]?"
- "Use [Notebook Name] to summarize the main points of [Source]"

## 5. Troubleshooting

If the server stops responding or authentication fails:

1. **Health Check**: Run `mcp_notebooklm_get_health` to check connection status.
2. **Re-auth**: Use `mcp_notebooklm_re_auth` to sign in again.
3. **Deep Clean**: If issues persist, use `mcp_notebooklm_cleanup_data(confirm=true, preserve_library=true)` and then `setup_auth` for a fresh start.
